              PRAG provides five or ten-year warranty on all Lithium batteries installed by PRAG or
              its Authorized Distributors. Our Lithium batteries are built to the highest industry
              standards, designed for longevity and superior performance when used correctly. PRAG
              shall not be held responsible for improper battery usage or failure to comply with the
              provided specifications.

                The warranty applies only when the batteries are used in accordance with the
                specifications outlined below:

                <li>
                  <strong>Inverter:</strong> The specification of the inverter must be one that has
                  the capacity to charge the batteries efficiently. It must be either an inverter
                  that can communicate well with the battery BMS or an inverter that has a
                  &ldquo;battery type settings&rdquo; feature embedded in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Environment:</strong> The lithium battery must be installed in a
                  well-ventilated space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Installation:</strong> Lithium batteries must be installed with the
                  right inverter, cables, and other installation kits.

                <strong>Condition of Returned Batteries:</strong> Batteries must be returned in
                their original condition, without tampering or physical damage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Proration of Warranty:</strong> In the event of battery failure within the
                warranty period, a prorated refund will be issued. If a battery is found to be
                defective and cannot be repaired, the customer is entitled to a refund for the
                unused portion of the warranty period.

              <li>
                <strong>Load Management:</strong> Minimize the load on the inverter to extend
                battery life. It is recommended not to exceed 40% of the inverter&apos;s maximum
                rated capacity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid Mixing Battery Brands:</strong> Do not mix different brands of Lithium
                batteries, as this will significantly shorten the life of the battery set.
                Similarly, new batteries can only be added when only about 800 cycles of the old
                batteries have been used. Batteries in a set are to be replaced at the same time to
                maintain performance and longevity.

              Backup time or autonomy decreases over time with battery usage. The battery life
