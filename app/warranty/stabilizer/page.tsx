                If, within the warranty period the PRAG stabilizer was installed and operated in
                accordance with Pragmatic Technologies standards and procedures, then the Company
                will, at its cost (subject to the terms of this document), correct any defects on the
                product or workmanship.

                If the product has been modified, recalibrated, repaired, opened or tampered with in
                any way by the customer, then this warranty will not apply.

                Unless otherwise specified in this document, the product must be returned to
                Pragmatic Technologies Service Center at the customer&apos;s cost in the event of a

                If Pragmatic Technologies, at its sole discretion, determines that the conditions of
                this document have been met and the product has failed as a result of an event
                described in item (1), the Company will, at its cost, return the customer to
                subsisting condition(s) prior to the warranty claim.

                inspection, determines to be outside of the conditions set out in this warranty
                document or is found to be not faulty, then a minimum inspection fee of ₦2,500.00
                (Two Thousand Five Hundred Naira Only) will be charged. In case of disconnection of
                the product for repairs or replacement, the customer will be responsible for

                Blown fuses/brushes are usually as a result of overload and are not considered to be

                product failed due to a blown fuse, a handling and inspection charge will apply as
                above and transportation costs will be borne by the customer as detailed in (7)
                above.
